# Airline-Safety-Analysis
This project presents the visualization to show the airlines safety trends and condition from the perspective of airline company.

Everyday Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is handling more than  45,000 flights and at the peak operational time there are about 5,400 aircraft in the sky. When people travel through airplanes they usually have a mindset of whether it is safe or not.  This is because we are under other's control and are not touching the ground. This can be compared with people driving their vehicles, where people always feel safe as they are controlling the vehicle themselves and and can pull over immediately if something goes wrong with the vehicle. Air travel is the safest means of transportation but it is still being brought into the conversation regarding passenger's safety. 

The reason airplane accidents get the attention is because it takes life of large number of people and the inner fear that people always have when they air travel. Air travel is increasing  and so it the technology. With advancement of safety features and technology air travel has become one of the safest means of transportation and the data beyond air travel also show similar trend. 

We have heard of many news around the media about the concern of safety of air passengers. Today we will be looking into how safe the air travel is.  When people travel through airplanes they usually have a mindset of whether it is safe or not.  This is because we are under other's control and are not touching the ground. This can be compared with people driving their vehicles, where people always feel safe as they are controlling the vehicle themselves and and can pull over immediately if something goes wrong with the vehicle. 

Even though media has speculated the rumor that air travel is not safe for travel the data beyond air travel gives us clear idea on how safe it is. Let's look into some data analysis that will show how safe it is.

Looking at the data for two different time period (1985-1999 and 2000-2014) we can see that air travel is getting safer. We can see the decrease in number for number of incidents and number of fatal accidents. The number of incidents that happens in the plane and the number of fatal accidents that happens when the incident occurs has reduced drastically. The fatal accidents reduced by almost 70%, which is huge and is getting safer with new technologies.

Looking at the fatalities for every km distance we see there are no US airlines in the top 25 list which suggest that they are one of the safest airlines in the world which could be because of its  air travel and maintenance policy. This could be because of the advancement in the technology and proper air travel inspection and maintenance rules.

Over the last 10 years, passenger vehicle death rate per 100,000,000 passenger miles was over 10 times higher than for buses, 17 times higher than for passenger trains, and 1,623 times higher than for scheduled airlines.

Looking at the data for 20 years timeframe we can tell that air travel is getting safer and is one of the safest means of transportation.
