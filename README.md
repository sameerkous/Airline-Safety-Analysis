# Airline-Safety-Analysis
This project presents the visualization to show the airlines safety trends and condition from the perspective of airline company.

Everyday Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is handling more than  45,000 flights and at the peak operational time there are about 5,400 aircraft in the sky. When people travel through airplanes they usually have a mindset of whether it is safe or not.  This is because we are under other's control and are not touching the ground. This can be compared with people driving their vehicles, where people always feel safe as they are controlling the vehicle themselves and and can pull over immediately if something goes wrong with the vehicle. Air travel is the safest means of transportation but it is still being brought into the conversation regarding passenger's safety. 

The reason airplane accidents get the attention is because it takes life of large number of people and the inner fear that people always have when they air travel. Air travel is increasing  and so it the technology. With advancement of safety features and technology air travel has become one of the safest means of transportation and the data beyond air travel also show similar trend.
